# Crypto_Correlation_Simulator
This Python script analyzes Bitcoin (BTC) and Dogecoin (DOGE) historical data, simulating a trading strategy that buys and sells DOGE based on Bitcoin's price trends. The goal is to track a dynamic Dogecoin investment, making buy/sell decisions solely from Bitcoin's movements, and showing how the investment evolves over the year.
